                            <p>Years ago,
                                formulating beverages was relatively simple: most consumers just wanted
                                great-tasting products. Today, beverage formulators must maintain their high
                                standards for flavor while adapting to a wide range of label requirements. Modern
                                consumers want products that are clean label, mineral and vitamin-fortified,
                                low-calorie, sustainable, allergen-free, non-GMO, and organic-certified, to name
                                just a few.</p>

                                and carbonated beverages. This is an especially refreshing flavor for seltzer. In most
